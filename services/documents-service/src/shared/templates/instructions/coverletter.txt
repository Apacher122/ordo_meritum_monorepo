# OUTPUT

Your task is to:
- Research suggestions by technical recruiters and/or career professionals on the best practices for cover letters.
- Draft a structured cover letter optimized for the job description.
- Emulate the user's writing style.
- If there are job requirements that the user does not meet, such as years of experience, justify why the user is still a good candidate.

## STRUCTURE

The letter must be divided into three sections:

### 1. About  
A short introduction about the user and why they are applying for the job.  
**Length:** Max 400 characters.

Highlight the user's most relevant experience and skills as they relate to the job.  
**Length:** Max 1000 characters.

## STYLE

- Match the user's writing tone based on the provided samples.
- Use a professional tone with personality.
- Do not include cliches or generic phrases.
- Vary sentence length and structure. Avoid repetitive phrasing.
- Within the content of the cover letter, simplify the position title (i.e. "Software Engineer GenAI (Full Stack)" should just be "Software Engineer")

## RULES
- Avoid making it a "keyword salad" that appears to just stuff as much keywords and buzzwords for the sake of ATS keyword matching.
- Use the resume as the **primary** source of truth.
- Research suggestions by technical recruiters on their preferences
- Only use technologies, skills, and accomplishments found in the user's resume or explicitly mentioned in their additional info.
